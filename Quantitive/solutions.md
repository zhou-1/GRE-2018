# 1. Circle and coordinate   
1. Area of circle: get radius of circle, sqrt((1+3)^2+3^2), which is r, area of circle: pi*r^2    
2.   


# 2. Number    
1. key here is the greatest value. Understanding of median number which is the middle number of all 5 numbers. Right now, we have 480, 490, 510, 520. 510 is the second biggest number, it could be a middle number if x is the biggest number. If 510 is average number, 550 should be x.   
2. understanding of question is super important. A: number of integers qualified: 12, 16, 20, 24, 28, 32, 36, 40, 44, 48, 52, 56, 60, 64, 68, 72, 76....100, total: 23, 4*23=92. B: number of integers qualified: 15, 20, 25, 30, ....100, total: 18, 5*18=90. A is greater.   



# 3. Multiple options   
1. only 36-20=16 clients who own cats but no dogs, C; 70-16=54 who own dogs including own both, A; 54-20=34 clients who own dogs but no cats, B.
