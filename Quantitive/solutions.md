# 1. Circle and coordinate   
1. Area of circle: get radius of circle, sqrt((1+3)^2+3^2), which is r, area of circle: pi*r^2    
2.   


# 2. Number    
1. key here is the greatest value. Understanding of median number which is the middle number of all 5 numbers. Right now, we have 480, 490, 510, 520. 510 is the second biggest number, it could be a middle number if x is the biggest number. If 510 is average number, 550 should be x.   
2. understanding of question is super important. A: number of integers qualified: 12, 16, 20, 24, 28, 32, 36, 40, 44, 48, 52, 56, 60, 64, 68, 72, 76....100, total: 23, 4*23=92. B: number of integers qualified: 15, 20, 25, 30, ....100, total: 18, 5*18=90. A is greater.     
3. Understanding the purpose of the question, not which one is valuable but has biiger value which means least valuable. We can say size of big is 5, small then is 2; price of big is 2, small is 1; small: 1/2 bigger than big: 2/5.     
4. x^(a* b)    
5. Assume first 3 months is 0, (9-3)* x=43, x=7.x; 7.x* 9 = 63. However, in first 3 months, there must has numbers, so less than 63 is proper which only is 57.    



# 3. Multiple options   
1. only 36-20=16 clients who own cats but no dogs, C; 70-16=54 who own dogs including own both, A; 54-20=34 clients who own dogs but no cats, B.
