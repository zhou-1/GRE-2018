# 1. Circle and coordinate   
1. Area of circle: get radius of circle, sqrt((1+3)^2+3^2), which is r, area of circle: pi* r^2    
2. It is a question about circle. All places that are 20 inches from P, which makes a circle centered at P, radius is 20 inches, and point R is on the circle. When PR = RQ, which makes triangle PRQ a equilateral triangle, then angle RPQ is 60 degree, do not forget negative part based on X axis, so total angle is 60* 2 which is 120 degree, where R is closer to Q. Remaining 360-120 =240 degree, point R is closer to P. The probability when R is closer to P, 240 degree/ 360 degree which is 2/3.      
3. OR=OS=r, OS didvide angle RST evenly, so triangle ORS is equilateral. So r = RS = 4. Perimeter of circle is 2* pi* r=8pi. Angle of arc RWT is 360 - 120 = 240 degree. So arc RWT is 8* pi* 240/360 = 16pi/3.     
4. equation of line: y=ax+b, a =2, b can be anything; when x=3, y can be 2* 3+b, b can be any number. so cannot determine 3 and 6+b.    


# 2. Triangle    
1. possible biggest: 7+5=12, possible smallest: 7-5=2; between 2 and 12 is possible one.       


# 3. Number    
1. key here is the greatest value. Understanding of median number which is the middle number of all 5 numbers. Right now, we have 480, 490, 510, 520. 510 is the second biggest number, it could be a middle number if x is the biggest number. If 510 is average number, 550 should be x.   
2. understanding of question is super important. A: number of integers qualified: 12, 16, 20, 24, 28, 32, 36, 40, 44, 48, 52, 56, 60, 64, 68, 72, 76....100, total: 23, 4*23=92. B: number of integers qualified: 15, 20, 25, 30, ....100, total: 18, 5*18=90. A is greater.     
3. Understanding the purpose of the question, not which one is valuable but has biiger value which means least valuable. We can say size of big is 5, small then is 2; price of big is 2, small is 1; small: 1/2 bigger than big: 2/5.     
4. x^(a* b)    
5. Assume first 3 months is 0, (9-3)* x=43, x=7.x; 7.x* 9 = 63. However, in first 3 months, there must has numbers, so less than 63 is proper which only is 57.    
6. Key here is each of the next two years. So year by year. p* 1.038* 1.038 = 1.077p. A is bigger than 1.076p. A is bigger.     
7. 2.5* 10 >> 3.5* 10^(-6), latter can be ignored, positive result. 62.5* 10^6/ 25 ~ 2.5* 10^6.      
8. x percent of y: x* 0.01* y; y percent of x: y* 0.01* x; they are same!!    
9. Standard deviation, s = sqrt[(sum from i=1 to N (Xi - average of X)^2)/(N-1)]     



# 4. Coordinates   
1. slope of l: (-1-5)/(6-(-4)) = -3/5; line k is perpendicular to line l, slope of k * slope of l = -1. Therefore, slope of k is 5/3.     
2. It seems we have two answers, m could be 2 or -2. But when m=2, x-intercept is negative number, y-intercept is positive number, not twice of x-inter. So m could only be 2. Tricky but needs attention!!!    


# 5. Data, table  
1. (72%* 1200-55%* 1200)/55%* 1200 = 204/660 = 30.9% ~ 31%    
2. Understanding is essential. The ratio of the numbr of companies offering both a stock-options incentive and one of the benefits listed / the number of companies offering that benifit ||  is greatest || question: for which of the five benefits? 41/303 is greatest, which is tution benefit.     
 


# 6. Probabilities    
1. (3+2+1)* 2 =12 ways      


# 7. Multiple options   
1. only 36-20=16 clients who own cats but no dogs, C; 70-16=54 who own dogs including own both, A; 54-20=34 clients who own dogs but no cats, B.   


# 8. Trick questions   
1. Only one situation: -3, -2, -1, 0, 1, 2, 3. The product of all is 0, median integer is 0. Least value is -3.        
2. Understanding!!!! 理解题意！！ “selects at least 2 pencils of each color” means two pencils of red at least. So, all 6 pencils of 4 of the other colors, 4* 6 = 24. One of last color, 24+1=25. Another of last color, 25+1=26, two of the last color. Done!!!!!!
3. Understand what the question wants us to compare. The percent increase is same for both. $1/$20. So it is false.       
4. 如果第一个委员会的 8 个人都是第二个委员会的成员，而第二个委员会的 10 个人都是第三个委员会的成员的话，那么这三个委员会合起来只有 13 个人，但不会更少了。 答案是13      
5. 最小的范围，看最大值和最小值的差，是不是最小     
6. 35-24=11, people including Amy and Jed after those 24 front people, 11-2=9, get rid of Amy and Jed. 35=15=20. 20 (including Amy)+9=29. in front of Jed.
